# Project Vision

## Our Mission
Build a fast, secure, and maintainable web platform that prioritizes user experience and developer productivity.

## Core Principles

### 1. Performance First
- All features must be optimized for speed
- Bundle size should be kept minimal
- Load times under 2 seconds for all pages

### 2. Security by Design
- Implement security controls at every layer
- Regular security audits and updates
- Zero-trust architecture principles

### 3. Developer Experience
- Clear, self-documenting code
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Automated tooling and workflows

### 4. User-Centric Design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive enhancement

### 5. Maintainability
- Modular architecture
- Consistent coding standards
- Regular dependency updates

## What We Avoid
- Technical debt without remediation plans
- Breaking changes without migration paths
- Features that compromise security or performance
- Complexity for complexity's sake

## Success Metrics
- Page load speed < 2s
- Test coverage > 90%
- Zero high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Developer onboarding time < 1 day
